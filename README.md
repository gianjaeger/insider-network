## Overview

This project visualises insider trading networks derived from SEC insider trade filings (2014â€“2024).  
Edges in the network represent temporal similarity in trading patterns between insiders within the same company.  
The site allows you to:

- Search for a **company** (by name or ticker).
- Browse its **connected components** (subgraphs).
- Interactively explore insiders and their trading links.

All graph data is preprocessed into JSON files for fast loading in the browser.
